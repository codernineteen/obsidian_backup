# Mentality

1. progress != visible works.
	Although the little drawing a triangle looks too simple, it requires lots of neccessary knowledge about Vulkan.

2. human always forget.
	graphics pipeline in Vulkan is very deep. so keep pausing and reminding that where we are now and what we've learned.

3. There are many ways to do something.
4. refer to Vulkan specification as soon as possible.
